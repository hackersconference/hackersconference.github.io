The Hackers Conference is an annual invite-only conference of [hackers](http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/H/hacker.html), traditionally held in the San Francisco Bay area. The conference began in 1984, and has been held annually since 1986.

The conference is now run by "The Hackers Conference", a 501(c)3 non-profit corporation based in California whose mission is to encourage the celebration and perpetuation of hacker culture by providing a place where people with [the hacker nature](http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/H/has-the-X-nature.html) can come together and learn about the world.
