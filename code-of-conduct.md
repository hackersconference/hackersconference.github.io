Hackers is dedicated to providing a safe and harassment-free conference experience for all participants. We do not tolerate endangerment, exposure, abuse, or harassment of persons or their equipment and possessions, in any form.

### Harassment
Some examples of harassment are (this is a non-exhaustive list): offensive verbal comments related to characteristics such as sex, gender, ethnicity, nationality, language, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, religion; sexual or discriminatory images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, or immediate expulsion from the conference, or removal from the conference’s invitation list. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a steering committee member immediately. Steering committee members can be identified by their yellow name badges

Steering committee members will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at the conference venue and at conference-related social events.

### Demo Room
Some examples of demo room usage concerns are (this is a non-exhaustive list): sexually and/or medically explicit devices or images, or dangerous devices. Such things should not be easily viewable or accessible without prior warning and authorization. Demos must also be conducted safely and as appropriate for an indoor hotel space.

### Online Usage
Some examples of inappropriate online usage are (this is a non-exhaustive list): breaking into other attendee’s systems, password sniffing or cracking, using mailing lists for harassment.

## Attendee Procedure For Handling Incidents

All steering committee members will be wearing a yellow name tag. Steering committee members will also be prepared to handle incidents. All of our steering committee members are informed of the code of conduct and guide for handling incidents at the conference. There will be a mandatory steering committee meeting during conference preparation when this will be reiterated as well.

Report the incident (preferably in writing) to a steering committee member - all reports are confidential.

When reporting the event to a steering committee member, try to gather as much information as available, but do not interview people about the incident - a steering committee member will assist you in writing the report/collecting information.

The important information consists of:

* Identifying information (name) of the participant violating the code of conduct
* The behavior that was in violation
* The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time the report was made)
* The circumstances surrounding the incident
* Other people involved in the incident

The steering committee members are well informed on how to deal with the incident and how to further proceed with the situation.

If everyone is presently physically safe, involve law enforcement or security only at a victim’s request. If you do feel your safety in jeopardy please do not hesitate to contact local law enforcement by dialing 911. If you do not have a cell phone, you can use any hotel phone or simply ask a staff member.
