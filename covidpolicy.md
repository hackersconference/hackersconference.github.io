**Proof of COVID-19 Vaccination and Negative COVID-19 Test is required before entry**.

We will perform on-site COVID-19 rapid tests and provide a way to pre-verify that you are fully vaccinated.

**Masks are strongly encouraged in indoor spaces, but not required.**

Please understand and respect that wearing a mask is a personal and individual choice of your fellow conference attendees.  We ask that you respect that choice. We will provide outdoor seating for all meals. In addition, we are working to improve ventilation and air filtration in all meeting rooms. Masks will be made available for attendees on-site at conferences upon request.

We ask that you please **not** attend if:

* Within 7 days before the event, you have tested positive for COVID-19.   
* Within 48 hours before the event, you have experienced symptoms of illness such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain/achiness, headache, sore throat, diarrhea, vomiting, or fatigue.


All attendees are asked to agree to the following policies and guidelines at the time of registration: 

* By registering for this conference, I agree that I will carefully review and, during the event and all event-related activities, comply with all applicable COVID-19-related federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and guidance and any other protocols that may be implemented by The Hackers Conference or the conference venue.   
 
* I acknowledge that The Hackers Conference cannot guarantee that attendees will not be exposed to or contract COVID-19 while attending the conference, and that by attending they may be exposing or increasing their risk of contracting or spreading COVID-19. 
 
* I understand that The Hackers Conference will continue to closely monitor conditions related to COVID-19 between now and the start of the conference, and reserves the right to modify its COVID-19 related procedures and health screening protocols should conditions change. Registrants will be informed of any such changes on an ongoing basis. As a condition of attendance and participation, I agree to follow the protocols as required. Refusal to abide by COVID-19 related procedures will result in ejection from the conference and cancellation of their registration, without refund.
