### About The Conference

The Hackers Conference is an annual invitation-only conference traditionally held in the San Francisco Bay Area. The conference began in 1984, and has been held annually since 1986.

The conference is run by the "The Hackers Conference, Inc", a 501(c) non-profit corporation whose mission is to encourage the celebration and perpetuation of [hacker](http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/H/hacker.html) culture. Each year, it brings together incredible people who embody the [hacker ethos](http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/H/has-the-X-nature.html), to give them a forum to meet, communicate, and interact with others from different disciplines, to form connections, and to inspire.
